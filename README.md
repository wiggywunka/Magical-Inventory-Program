# NON-FUNCTIONING #
Please don't expect to make anything of it as it's just garbled nothing in a void of nothingness.

# Magical-Inventory-Program
A magical inventory program written in Java + JavaFX niceness.

## Setup
### How do I get setup?
This isn't functional and was initially more of a "can I somehow do this?" type of projects.

## FAQ
### What is this?
A java based inventory "management" program that's more of a learning experiment than a actual business application.

### How does it work?
Well...at the moment...It doesn't actually work. I'm putting it together at the moment.

### Why put it online if it doesn't work?
I like open-ness. I want to be open about where I am and how I work. This is it.
